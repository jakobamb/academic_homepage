Hi, thanks for visiting my website! I am a master's student in Computer Science from Hamburg Germany. With a background in Human-Computer Interaction (BSc) and Informatics (MSc; focus Machine Learning), I am fascinated by the challenges and possibilities at the intersection of HCI and AI. I believe that for AI to be helpful, safe and usable, it needs to be developed from a human-centered perspective.

My current work is in explainable AI for Human-Robot Interaction, and in explaining multimodal deep learning models, using natural language explanations and visualization techniques. At the moment, I am writing my master's thesis, titled "Benchmarking Faithfulness: Towards Accurate Natural Language Explanations in Vision-Language Tasks".

I am actively looking for PhD positions in the area of Human-Centered AI, XAI, interactive AI or multimodal Deep Learning and I am greatful for any hints or offers!

Have a look at my [projects page](/projects) for some random other work, such as a [citizen-science application to track jellyfish](/projects/1_jelly_spotter/).
