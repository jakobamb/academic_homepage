"Lost in IKUM" is a virtual-reality escape-room game. It serves as a prototype for [redirected walking](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5072212?casa_token=gGVdyPY4ZXIAAAAA:fAFzYsoAuLNbq29my7I3wTHqRQFiXwBVESWnENBHZw-NJ9sI6W0yOoUUJ3PyhRQ29R9VWKlV68s), a technique used to increase the perceived playable area in VR by manipulating the rotation speed of a user, leading to a rotation gain. This effect is not disruptive or even noticeable when introduced with the right amount of gain and a suitable gameplay scenario. 
When combined with another method called [impossible spaces](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6165136?casa_token=wt5vrz0q2nkAAAAA:il8NRQlyGJxjEkK6ItuW7lq80my-GC5-ZrLQyta6k68lI-0TgxaJ10EsTXn9u7ScI8vhzFeoPw0), where rooms in-game intersect with each other, a considerably larger space is perceived than physically available in reality. In our prototype, these tricks are leveraged to increase the effective playable area by almost a factor of three.

The game was developed in a hackathon-style practical course in student teams. We have submitted our game to the department's EXPO 2020, where it made the third place. You can find the submission [here](https://basecamp-demos.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/expo2020/entries/lost-in-ikum/) with a more detailed description of the project in German, as well as a trailer and walkthrough video.

You can download the [source code](https://github.com/jakobamb/LostIKUM) of the game on GitHub. The game was developed for Oculus Quest 1.
